        Throughout the study, you will be paired with other participants who are also taking part in the study.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to the Toluna points you receive for participating, you can receive <b> bonus points</b> based on <b>your own</b> <u>and</u> <b>other participants'</b> decisions.
        At the end of the study, the bonus points you collected will be converted into Toluna points at the following conversion rate:
    </p>
    <p>
        1 point = {{ session.real_world_currency_per_point }} Toluna points
    </p>
    <p>
        You will make decisions in different <b>situations</b> and in different <b>roles</b>. At the end of the study,
        <b> <u>one</u> situation</b> and <b> <u>one</u> role</b> will be randomly selected to <b>determine your bonus points</b>. Since you will not know
        in advance which decision will count, you should <b>treat each decision as if it is selected</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bonus points are calculated once all participants have completed the study.
    </p>

    <b>
        Please read the instructions carefully, as your decisions affect not only your own Toluna points but also those of other participants.
