        Welcome to this study on decision-making!
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the payment you will receive for participating,
        you can receive bonus points based on your decisions and the decisions of others in the study.
        At the end, these points will be converted into real money using the following conversion rate:
    </p>
    <p>
        1 point = {{ session.real_world_currency_per_point }}
    </p>
    <p>
        Your anonymity is guaranteed during the whole study,
        to both the other participants and the experimenters.
        You will make decisions about different scenarios, and in different roles.
        At the end of the study,
        one scenario will be chosen at random, and you will be paid the bonus based on the decisions you and others made in that scenario,
        depending on your role. Since you do not know which scenario counts for your extra points,
        you should treat each scenario as if it would be the one that counts,
    </p>
    <p>
        Please read the instructions carefully,
        as your compensation from Toluna will be based on the points you receive during the study.
