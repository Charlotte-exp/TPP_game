Study overview and bonus points

<div>
    <p>
        In addition to the Toluna points you will receive for participating, you can receive <b> bonus points</b>.
        Bonus points are determined by your decisions and the decisions of others who are also participating in the study.
        At the end of the study, the points you collected will be converted into Toluna points using the following conversion rate:
    </p>
    <p>
        1 point = {{ session.real_world_currency_per_point }} Toluna points
    </p>
    <p>
        You will make decisions in different <b>situations</b> and in different <b>roles</b>. At the end of the study,
        one situation and one role will be chosen at random and your bonus points will be determined
        by your own and others' decisions in this situation. Since you do not know which decision counts
        for your extra points, you should treat each decision as if it would be the one that counts.

    </p>
    <p>
        Your anonymity is guaranteed during the whole study, to both the other participants and the researchers.
    <p>

    <p>
        Please read the instructions carefully, as the points you collect during the study will impact your Toluna points and those of other participants.
