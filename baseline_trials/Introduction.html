        Throughout the study, you will be paired with other participants who are also taking part in the study.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to the compensation you receive for participating,
        you can receive <b> bonus points</b> based on <b>your own</b> <u>and</u> <b>other participants'</b> decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> 1 point = {{ session.real_world_currency_per_point }} GBP </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        You will make decisions in different <b>situations</b> and in different <b>roles</b>. At the end of the study,
        <b> <u>one</u> situation</b> and <b> <u>one</u> role</b> will be randomly selected to <b>determine your bonus points</b>. Since you will not know
        in advance which decision will count, you should <b>treat each decision as if it is selected</b>.
    </p>

    <h6><u>Block 1</u></h6>

     <p>
        There are two blocks in this study: a longer first block and a shorter second block.
         In the first block, you will make decisions in different <b>situations</b> and in different <b>roles</b>.
         After the first block of decisions,
        <b> <u>one</u> situation</b> and <b> <u>one</u> role</b> from the first block will be randomly selected to <b>determine your bonus points</b> in the first block.
    </p>

      <h6><u>Block 2</u></h6>

    <p>
        In the second block, you will make additional decisions in different <b>situations</b>,
        using your bonus points from the first block. After the second block, again
        <b> <u>one</u> situation</b> will be randomly selected to <b>determine your final bonus points</b>.
    </p>

     <h6><u>After the study</u></h6>

    <p>
        Bonus points are calculated after all participants have completed the study.
        They cannot be negative. Since you will not know in advance which decisions will count,
        you should <b>treat each decision as if it is selected</b>.
    </p>

    <b>
        Please read the instructions carefully, as your decisions affect not only your payoff but also those of other participants.
