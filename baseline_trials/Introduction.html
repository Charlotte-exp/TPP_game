    <h6><u>Block 1</u></h6>

     <p>
        There are two blocks in this study: a longer first block and a shorter second block. In the first block, you will make decisions in different <b>situations</b> and in different <b>roles</b>. After the first block of decisions,
        <b> <u>one</u> situation</b> and <b> <u>one</u> role</b> from the first block will be randomly selected to <b>determine your bonus points</b> in the first block.
    </p>

      <h6><u>Block 2</u></h6>

    <p>
        In the second block, you will make additional decisions in different <b>situations</b>, using your bonus points from the first block. After the second block, again
        <b> <u>one</u> situation</b> will be randomly selected to <b>determine your final bonus points</b>.
    </p>

     <h6><u>After the study</u></h6>

    <p>
        Bonus points are calculated after all participants have completed the study. They cannot be negative. Since you will not know in advance which decisions will count, you should <b>treat each decision as if it is selected</b>.
