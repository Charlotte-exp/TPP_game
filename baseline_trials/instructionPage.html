        <p>In each decision situation, you will be paired with a different study participant. You will also be assigned a role for every decision (for example, Person A or Person B).</p>

        <p>The decision situation will look like this:</p>

        <p>[image with role labels]</p>

        <p><strong>Person A</strong> receives 12 points.<br>
        <strong>Person B</strong> receives 0 points.</p>

        <p><strong>Person A</strong> decides how many of the 12 points to give to Person B and how many to keep. Person B does not make a decision.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>In this practice exercise, you are Person A, which is indicated by the red rectangle. You receive 12 points and Person B receives 0 points. You will decide how many points to give to Person B. To make a decision, click on a number. As you move your cursor over the numbers (or press them on your phone), you will see how many points you and Person B would receive.</p>

        You have decided to give <strong>[dic_give]</strong> point(s) to Person B and keep <strong>[12 - dic_give]</strong> point(s) for yourself.</p>

        <p>In this example, you were assigned to the role of Person A. You will also sometimes be assigned to the role of Person B. When you are Person B, you will not see this decision situation, because Person B does not make any decision.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>You will also make a decision about the social acceptability of Person A’s decisions. You will be shown different possible decisions of Person A. Then you decide how socially acceptable this decision is, among the following options:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Very socially <strong>un</strong>acceptable</li>
            <li>Socially <strong>un</strong>acceptable</li>
