Introduction,intro_pairing,"Throughout the study, you will be paired with other participants. The pairings are hypothetical but based on how participants could interact."
Introduction,intro_prolific,"You can receive <b> bonus points</b> based on <b>your</b> decisions. At the end of the study, the bonus points you collected will be converted into money at the following conversion rate:"
Introduction,intro_conversion,1 point = {conversion} GBP
Introduction,intro_toluna,"In addition to the compensation you receive for participating, you can receive <b> bonus points</b> based on <b>your own</b> <u>and</u> <b>other participants'</b> decisions."
Introduction,intro_block1_title,Block 1
Introduction,intro_block1,"There are two blocks in this study. In the first block, you will make decisions in different <b>situations</b> and in different <b>roles</b>. <b><u>One</u> situation</b> and <b><u>one</u> role</b> from this block will be randomly selected to <b>determine your bonus points</b>."
Introduction,intro_block2_title,Block 2
Introduction,intro_block2,"In the second block, you will make additional decisions in different <b>situations</b>, using your bonus points from the first block. After the second block, <b><u>one</u> situation</b> will be randomly selected to <b>determine your final bonus points</b>."
Introduction,intro_points_title,After the study
Introduction,intro_points,"Bonus points are calculated after all participants have completed the study. They cannot be negative. Since you will not know which decisions will count, you should <b>treat each decision as if it is selected</b>."
Introduction,intro_carefully,"Please read the instructions carefully, as your decisions affect your payoff."
Instructions,instru_0DG_pairing,"In <u>each</u> decision, you will be paired with a <b>different study participant</b>. You will also be assigned a role for every decision (for example, Person A or Person B)."
Instructions,instru_0DG_decision,A decision can look like this:
Instructions,instru_0DG_points,<strong>Person A</strong> receives 12 points. <br><strong>Person B</strong> receives 0 points.
Instructions,instru_0DG_rules,<strong>Person A</strong> decides how many of the 12 points to <b>give</b> to <b>Person B</b> and how many to keep for themselves. Person B does not make a decision.
Instructions,instru_2PP_stages,"In the next parts, each interaction has <strong>two stages</strong>."
Instructions,instru_2PP_points,"In <b>Stage 1</b>, Person A always receives 12 points and decides how many to give to Person B."
Instructions,instru_2PP_stage2,"<b>After</b> Person A makes their decision, <strong>Stage 2</strong> begins."
Instructions,instru_2PP_remove,"In  <b> Stage 2</b>, Person A and Person B both receive additional 4 points. Then, <b> Person B</b> can <b> remove points</b> from  <b> Person A</b>. Removing <b>1 point</b> from Person A costs Person B <b> {cost_per_point}</b>."
Instructions,instru_2PP_role,"Depending on the situation, you can be Person A or Person B."
Instructions,instru_3PP_change,Now there is one change.
Instructions,instru_3PP_personc,There will be a third person: <b >Person C.</b>
Instructions,instru_3PP_remove,"Person B is <u>not</u> able to remove points anymore. Instead, <b style='color: red; '>Person C</b> is able to <b>remove points</b> from Person A."
Instructions,instru_3PP_rules,"In <b>Stage 2</b>, Person C receives additional 4 points. Removing <b>1 point</b> from Person A costs Person C <b> {cost_per_point}</b>. Points removed by Person C are eliminated."
